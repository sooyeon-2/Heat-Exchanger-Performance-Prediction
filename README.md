# Heat Exchanger Performance Prediction

This project uses a Kaggle dataset on heat exchanger performance to predict heat output using three different machine learning models:

- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor

Each model’s performance is evaluated using the R² score to determine predictive accuracy.

## Dataset

To run the code, you'll need the dataset. It can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desmondaubery/raretechsea1-60).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder (see below)  
3. Run the notebook or script in your Python environment  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib (or list your actual dependencies)
